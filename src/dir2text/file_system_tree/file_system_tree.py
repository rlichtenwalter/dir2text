class FileSystemTree:
    """A tree representation of a directory structure with support for exclusion rules.

    This class builds and maintains a tree representation of a directory structure,
    optionally filtering files and directories based on provided exclusion rules.
    It supports lazy tree building, directory/file counting, and both streaming and
    complete tree representations.

    The tree is built lazily on first access and can be refreshed to reflect filesystem
    changes. Both full tree access and iterative file listing are supported.

    Symbolic Link Behavior:
        By default, symbolic links are detected and represented as symlink nodes in the tree.
        When the follow_symlinks option is True, the contents of the symlink targets are
        included in the tree, and symlink loop detection prevents infinite recursion.

    Permission Handling:
        Permission errors during traversal can be handled in two ways:
        - IGNORE (default): Silently skip inaccessible files/directories
        - RAISE: Immediately raise PermissionError when access is denied

    Attributes:
        root_path (PathType): The absolute path to the root directory.
        exclusion_rules (Optional[BaseExclusionRules]): Rules for excluding files/directories.
        permission_action (PermissionAction): How to handle permission errors.
        follow_symlinks (bool): Whether to follow symbolic links during traversal.

    Example:
        >>> # Create a tree for the current directory without exclusions
        >>> tree = FileSystemTree(".")  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> # Print the complete tree
        >>> print(tree.get_tree_representation())  # doctest: +SKIP
